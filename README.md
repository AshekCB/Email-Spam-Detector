# Email Spam Detection System

This repository hosts the **Email Spam Detection System**, a machine learning-driven web application designed to detect spam emails efficiently. With a sleek, user-friendly interface, this system enables users to analyze email content and determine whether it is spam or not.

---

## **Overview**

The Email Spam Detection System leverages the power of machine learning to classify emails as spam or non-spam. It uses the **Random Forest Classifier**, a robust ensemble learning algorithm, for accurate and reliable predictions. The application is built using Python for backend processing and a combination of HTML and CSS for the frontend.
